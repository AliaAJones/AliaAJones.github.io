I am a first year PhD student in the Coastal Fisheries Research Lab at FIU. My research interests are centered around anthropogenic impacts on estuarine systems and I aim to conduct research that produces positive change in conservation and management of aquatic resources. My current research is on identifying the linkage between seagrass flats, prey abundance, and feeding habits/behavior of Permit (Trachinotus falcatus) from Biscayne Bay to Key West, in partnership with the Bonefish Tarpon Trust. This work will inform future management decisions in order to preserve the recreational Permit fishery.  

I'm a Floridian, passionate naturalist, and avid outdoorsman. I hold a Masters from the University of New Orleans and a Bachelors from the University of South Florida. If you're interested in my work or in any form of collaboration, please reach out!
